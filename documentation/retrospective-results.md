# Retrospective Meetings results
While we did not follow a full agile methodology, we used several agile principles to support smooth development and reflection. Our first retrospective meeting was held in Week 8, and a second is planned for the final project weeks. The long interval between retrospectives is explained by the unique nature of embedded systems projects and the way project weeks are distributed throughout the semester.

### Week 8 - Project Weeks 1–2
During our retrospective meeting in Week 8, we reflected on the early stage of the project, especially the first two project weeks. Overall, the group agreed that the progress was good, despite a few delays and changing scope.

The main challenge was the late delivery of hardware components, which limited hands-on work. However, we made the most of the available time by focusing on software preparation, electrical circuit planning, and testing individual components where possible.

Hardware research took more time than initially estimated, especially around motor selection and sources of power. While we had most of the scope defined, it kept changing due to our lack of awereness of possible options. The research resulted in several design changes but helped forming better-informed decisions. Hovewer, it should have been documented better both for the evidence andjustification of our choices later in the future.

We expect the visible progress to slow down temporarily, as the next stage involves preparation for full assembly and systems integration. Many results (e.g., propulsion, navigation, power behavior) will only become seen once the physical assembly is in process. This being said, we should breakdown the intermediate tasks into smaller scopes (e.g "Motors software implementation" into "Motors Software - Normal Mode", "Motors Software - Low Battery Mode", "Motors Software - Integration", etc). This way the progress will feel more real despite not having physical model yet fully working.


### Week 14 - last project weeks
During our second retrospective meeting in Week 14, we reflected on the final part of the project, focusing on the outcomes of the last few weeks and our overall group performance. Despite facing several challenges, we completed all must-have features on time and saw improvements in team coordination.

One area that could have been improved was the inconsistent use of the project board. While helpful at first, it became less reliable due to delayed updates and overly general task descriptions. This led to less effective use of the tool. A more structured and regularly updated task board would have supported better collaboration and more balanced task distribution across the team.

We also made several technical decisions late in the process, including changes to the electrical circuit. With better planning, we could have avoided the extra stress and saved both time and effort. Looking back, we should have allocated more time for safety considerations and potential last-minute changes.

Another problem was the uneven distribution of work across different areas. While having specialization is natural, it resulted in some team members having fewer deliverables in certain areas, making it harder to show evidence of their progress. For future projects, we will assign subtasks more attentively so that everyone can contribute in each area.

On the positive side, our group communication remained strong, and discussions during stand-up meetings helped us stay aligned throughout the project. We improved in time management and individual leadership, especially in leading the stand-ups. Additionally, as the semester progressed, we became much more confident with the tools and hardware, leading to greater efficiency and more informed decision-making.

Lastly, we realized the importance of documenting feedback and design decisions more clearly. Some changes and workarounds were made on the spot but weren’t properly recorded, which made it difficult to trace decisions later. The same applied to feedback — on several occasions, we failed to document it timely and had to do so later, often missing important details.

Despite these challenges, we are proud of the progress we made and how we adapted to difficulties. We gained experience working on a real-world embedded systems project, where unpredictable and hardware-related problems are part of the process. We all agree, in the case of a similiar project we would be able to complete it way faster and more efficiently, highlighting that the learning curve we went through significally increasing our knowledge.
