# Retrospective Meetings results
While we did not follow a full agile methodology, we used several agile principles to support smooth development and reflection. Our first retrospective meeting was held in Week 8, and a second is planned for the final project weeks. The long interval between retrospectives is explained by the unique nature of embedded systems projects and the way project weeks are distributed throughout the semester.

### Week 8 - Project Weeks 1â€“2
During our retrospective meeting in Week 8, we reflected on the early stage of the project, especially the first two project weeks. Overall, the group agreed that the progress was good, despite a few delays and changing scope.

The main challenge was the late delivery of hardware components, which limited hands-on work. However, we made the most of the available time by focusing on software preparation, electrical circuit planning, and testing individual components where possible.

Hardware research took more time than initially estimated, especially around motor selection and sources of power. While we had most of the scope defined, it kept changing due to our lack of awereness of possible options. The research resulted in several design changes but helped forming better-informed decisions. Hovewer, it should have been documented better both for the evidence andjustification of our choices later in the future.

We expect the visible progress to slow down temporarily, as the next stage involves preparation for full assembly and systems integration. Many results (e.g., propulsion, navigation, power behavior) will only become seen once the physical assembly is in process. This being said, we should breakdown the intermediate tasks into smaller scopes (e.g "Motors software implementation" into "Motors Software - Normal Mode", "Motors Software - Low Battery Mode", "Motors Software - Integration", etc). This way the progress will feel more real despite not having physical model yet fully working.
