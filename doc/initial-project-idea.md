## Context
Our project focuses on the development of an amphibious robotic duck designed to move both on land and water. The goal is to create a robotic system that mimics the behaviour of real ducks while seamlessly integrating into environments. By replicating the appearance and movement of a duck, the duck aims to provide an aesthetically pleasing and functional alternative to an actual duck in various places, such as private ponds, public parks, etc.

## Problem
Taking care of actual animals comes with great responsibility and a lot of work.
The robot duck however can be used to create a more nature-like atmosphere in the outdoor spaces like private ponds without the big responsibility of caring for live animals. Different than real ducks the robot does not produce waste, does not consume food and can not get sick and is therefore easier to maintain, while still having the upsides of being a pleasure to look at.


## Proposed Solution
We propose the development of an autonomous robotic duck that moves realistically on both water and land. This robotic system will be designed to blend seamlessly into natural environment and operate autonomously. By integrating robotics with nature-like design, this solution offers a unique balance between technology and environmental aspect, contributing to both functional and aesthetic needs.
