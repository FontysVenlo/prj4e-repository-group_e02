## Context
The duck we are trying to build is an amphibian robot that can move on water and land.  It is supposed to mimic the behaviour of a real duck and blend into the environment seemlessly.
## Problem
A problem would be that if you own a pond and you dont wanna take care of actual ducks. You can get robot ducks instead that is not making waste or engages in upleasent behaviour.

## Proposed Solution
The robot duck solves this problem by scaring aways other ducks but still fullfills the pleasent feeling of a duck presence in your local pond. It is nice to look at and a great entertainment every day.
