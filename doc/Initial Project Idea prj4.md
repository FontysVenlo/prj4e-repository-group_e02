## Context
The duck we are trying to build is an amphibian robot that can move on water and land.  It is supposed to mimic the behaviour of a real duck and blend into the environment seemlessly.
## Problem
A big problem is that our project team does not own an amphibic robot, since they are very expensive.

## Proposed Solution
Since we do not own an amphibic robot, in order to solve this problem, we are going to build one ourselves. The duck should be able to swim on water and also move on land, make quack noises and to wobble its rectrices (tail of the duck).
