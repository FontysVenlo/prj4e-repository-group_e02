## Context
Our project focuses on the development of an amphibious robotic duck designed to move both on land and water. The goal is to create a robotic system that mimics the behavior of real ducks while seamlessly integrating into environments. By replicating the appearance and movement of a duck, the duck aims to provide an aesthetically pleasing and functional alternative to an actual duck in various places, such as private ponds, public parks, etc.

## Problem
There is currently no non-intrusive and environmentally friendly solution for observing birds in their natural habitat without disturbing them. Traditional bird-watching often requires human presence, which can disrupt wildlife, while existing alternatives, such as static decorations or robotic toys, fail to replicate the lifelike movement and behavior of real birds. <br> 
Additionally, the duck can be used to create a more nature-like atmosphere in the outdoor spaces like private ponds without the responsibility of caring for live animals.


## Proposed Solution
We propose the development of an autonomous robotic duck that moves realistically on both water and land. This robotic system will be designed to blend seamlessly into natural enviroment and operate autonomously. By integrating robotics with nature-like design, this solution offers a unique balance between technology and environmental aspect, conributing to both functional and aestetic needs.
