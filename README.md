# Robot Duck
This repository holds the semester 4 embedded project - a robotic system that mimics duck's appearence and behaviour.

The structure is as follows:
- [Documentation](/documentation/) folder includes datasheets of the used components and document related deliverable files that we have used throughout the semester. 
- [Source](/src/DuckRobot/) folder with a software part of the project.
